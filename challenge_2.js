//there are three things wrong with this code. find them and fix them.
const some Number = 20; //the const here is the first mistake

someNumber = 50; // the second mistake is that the variable was declared with a space and the js does'nt recognises it
//solution

let someNumber = 20; // declared a varaible with space
someNUmber = 50; // noticed i used lete because the variable will be rea-assigned
